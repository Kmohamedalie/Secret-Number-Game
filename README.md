# Secret Number Game
Guessing a secret number with only 10 attempts is a game developed by me as part of my [JavaScript programming](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/?utm_campaign=website1010&utm_medium=website1010&utm_source=mycoupon) course with [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://codingheroes.io/). You can find and play the game [here](https://kmohamedalie.github.io/gsn/).
